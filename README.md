# -CSE-509-System-Security-Project


Approach :

The following approach will be followed:
Step 1: Implement port scanning and network scanning on a single node
Network scanning will be done by checking the response to ping

Port scanning will be done by performing the following types of scans:
- Full TCP connect scan
- TCP SYN scan
- TCP FIN scan

Step 2: Implement Web UI on master node (this task will be done in parallel with Step 1 above)
We will be using Django web framework and Bootstrap library.

Step 3: Implement distributed functionality

Python will be used for coding

Division of work:
Priyanka – Working on implementing Network scanning
Akanksha – Working on implementing Port scanning
Gourav – Working on the Web UI design and functionality
